                <p class="overlay-text">Crunch Time is the second game that I ever had a hand in developing. In this project I was forced to take upon a larger role as we lost both the head artist and sound designer from our team from last semester. This experience gave me the opportunity to gain skills in both pixel art and novice sound design. Together me and my team put out a final project that I am very proud of, and while the art may be slightly lacking in some aspects due to some of our inexperience, as a whole, this game is one that I am highly proud of, as it will serve as the bare minimum for future games to come.</p>

                <p class="overlay-text">Moby's Menagerie was the first game that I ever had a part in making. While the end product does display my inexperience at the time, the project did provide me with invaluable experience in learning C#, Unity Engine, and team management skills such as Trello. Not only this, but it was my first experience working on a large scale project in a team setting. Overall, this project is one that will always remain close to my heart, and I will never forget the skills that this game allowed me to learn.</p>
