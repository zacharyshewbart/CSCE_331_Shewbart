                Throughout my life, I have dedicated considerable time to various forms of service that is driven by a deep commitment to giving back to my community and honoring the memory of my late mother, Amy E. Shewbart. One of my notable volunteer experiences was at Angel's Attic in Grapevine, Texas, where I contributed to organizing and managing donations for families in need. This role allowed me to support the local community by ensuring that those facing difficult times had access to essential resources and assistance. Additionally, I served as a math tutor for high school students struggling with geometry. By providing one-on-one guidance, I helped students grasp complex concepts, improve their problem-solving skills, and boost their confidence in their academic abilities. This experience was particularly rewarding as it allowed me to make a tangible difference in the educational journey of young individuals. Another significant volunteer effort was at the Shrimp Boil, an event organized to benefit the Mother's Milk Bank under the Amy E. Shewbart Foundation. This foundation, established in memory of my mother, supports the provision of donor milk to infants in need. My involvement in this event included organizing, serving, and raising awareness for the critical work of the foundation. These volunteer experiences are not only a testament to my commitment to service but also a reflection of the values instilled in me through personal loss and dedication to meaningful causes. By contributing my time and effort to these organizations, I have sought to honor my motherâ€™s legacy and make a positive impact on those around me.
